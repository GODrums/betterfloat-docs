# Troubleshooting Guide

Extensions have to deal with a lot of different environments and configurations. Here are some common issues and how to solve them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I am on Chrome and the extension doesn't work. What should I do?">
    If the extension doesn't work as expected, try the following steps:
    - Make sure you have the latest version of the extension installed
    - Check if the extension is enabled in your browser and you can open the extension popup
    - Make sure to disable other extensions for the same websites
    - If you still have issues, please report them in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VQWXp33nSW)
  </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I am on Firefox and the extension doesn't work. What should I do?">
        In some cases, Firefox does not grant extensions the necessary permissions automatically. This can be fixed by following these steps:
        - Open the BetterFloat popup by clicking on the icon in the toolbar
        - Look for a warning symbol in the top bar of the popup - Click on the warning symbol and grant the necessary permissions in the newly opened popup of your browser
        - Open the BetterFloat popup again and check if the warning symbol is gone
        - If the warning symbol is still there, please report this issue in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VQWXp33nSW)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I would like to self-build the extension. What do I need to consider?" icon="code">
        Please note that we explicitly forbid the use of the extension for illegal activities. This includes but is not limited to using the extension to gain an unfair advantage over other users. We reserve the right to ban users from our services and report them to the respective platforms if they are found to be engaged in illegal activities.

        Henceforth, we explicitly forbid the use of our hosted services when building the extension from source.

        If you want to use all extension features, please set up your own servers or use the official extension from the Chrome Web Store or Mozilla Add-on Store.
