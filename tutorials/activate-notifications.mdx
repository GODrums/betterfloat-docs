## Step 1: Make sure you have the pro plan

Make sure you have the pro plan activated. The notification feature is only available for users with the pro plan.

## Step 2: Navigate to Skinport / CSFloat

Navigate to the Skinport LIVE-page or the CSFloat website. Activate the LIVE-mode on Skinport or auto-refresh on CSFloat. Be aware that these have to stay active for the notifications to work.

<Tip>CSFloat: You can filter shown items (including notifications) by using the site's filter options.</Tip>

## Step 3: Setup the notifications

Adjust the notification settings to your liking. You can choose between the following options:

- name: The name of the item. Can be any part of the full item name. E.g. "Karambit", "Case Hardened" or "Karambit | Case Hardened"
- float: Adjust the slider according to the float of the items. Using anything other than 0-1 means only skins with floats will be included.
- maximum market %: The maximum market percentage you want to be notified about. E.g. 90 means you will only be notified about items that at maximum 90% Buff / Steam / UU market price. The chosen provider can be selected is the same as the one you have selected in the extension settings.

<Warning>Make sure to save your settings by clicking on the `Save`-button.</Warning>
