## <Icon icon="note-sticky" /> Sticker Prices

This feature adds a sticker price indicator to the listing. It's a very common metric in trading and can be useful to quickly identify the overpay for the stickers on an item.

<Tip>For non-mathematicians: The sticker price (%SP) is the percentage of the un-applied sticker value incorporated into the price.</Tip>

### How is it calculated?

$SP = \dfrac{p_r - p_b}{\sum_{i=1}^{|s|} p_{s_i}}$

Where:

-   $SP$ is the displayed sticker price in %
-   $p_r$ is the price of the listing
-   $p_b$ is the base price of the item (for example the Buff price)
-   $|s|$ is the number of stickers on the item
-   $p_{s_i}$ is the base price of sticker $i$
