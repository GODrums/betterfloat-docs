## <Icon icon="shop" /> Source Markets

<Note>

For a market to be a reliable source, it must have a large number of listings and a high volume of transactions. Hence it makes no sense to add European markets to this list.

</Note>

| Market                                     | Buy Order Price (Bid) | Lowest Listed Price (Ask) | Description                                                                                                           |

BetterFloat attempts to convert prices into your selected site currency. If a market uses a base currency different than USD, our price provider, Pricempire, converts the prices to USD. Internally, prices are then fetched in USD (\$) and converted to the display currency after current market rates. For this conversion, we are using [freecurrencyapi.com](https://freecurrencyapi.com/)'s rates.

<Warning>

As a consequence, shown prices may differ slightly from ones you would get with a market's own currency conversion (e.g. Buff's USD conversion uses very outdates exchange rates).

Please compare the extension's prices to Pricempire directly before reporting potential price discrepancies.

</Warning>

When both Bid and Ask prices are available, BetterFloat's pricing element will take the following format:

<Icon icon="square-dollar" /> Bid Price | Ask Price

<Frame caption="Example: Listing priced at a Bid price of $2124.17 and an Ask price of $2240.40 on Buff163">
	<img src="/images/screenshots/bid-ask-prices.png" alt="Bid|Ask Prices" />
</Frame>

<Tip>

    BetterFloat has a warning system to help detecting pricing anormalities. In such cases, the extension will show a warning icon <Icon icon="triangle-exclamation" iconType="solid" color="orange" /> next to the price. For example, this can happen if the Bid price is higher than the Ask price.

</Tip>

### Primary price

<Info>Only available if the selected market has bid **and** ask prices available.</Info>

The primary price is the price that will be used in the pricing calculations. If available, it is always recommended to use the Buy Order price (Bid) as the primary price. It provides a more accurate representation of how much you can (re-)sell an item for.

### Alternative market

<Info>Only available if the selected market doesn't support every item.</Info>

If the selected market doesn't support every item, the alternative market will be used to calculate the price for those items. Just like for the original market, the primary price will be used if available.

<Warning>If 'None' is selected, affected items will not have a reference price.</Warning>

Examples:

-   Buff doesn't support cases/capsules/packages, so the alternative market will be used to calculate the price for those items
-   Steam has a price limit of $2000, so the alternative market will be used to calculate the price for items above that limit

### Supplement with Steam (CSFloat only)

<Info>Only available for CSFloat.</Info>

If enabled, the extension shows an additional indicator for the price percentage compared to the Steam price. This can be useful for items with very few listings across all markets, such as older stickers, capsules or packages.

<Frame caption="Example: A listing priced at 65% of the Steam price">
	<img src="/images/screenshots/supplement-with-steam.png" alt="Supplement with Steam" />
</Frame>

## <Icon icon="steam" /> Link to Steam Market Page

<Info>Only available for CSFloat.</Info>

If enabled, the extension adds a link to the Steam market page for each item. This can be useful for people who like to use the Steam market for the price history or reselling.

<Frame caption="Example: Clickable Steam symbol (link) on a Dragon Lore">
	<img src="/images/screenshots/steam-link.png" alt="Steam Link" />
</Frame>

## <Icon icon="tags" /> Price Difference

Recalculates and replaces the original discount tag according to the item's market price. This includes two independent options:

-   **Show Price Difference**: Shows the difference in absolute units.
-   **Show Price Difference Percentage**: Shows the difference in percentage.

<ins>Example:</ins>
An item is listed for \$100 and the reference price is \$80.

-   If both options are enabled, the tag will show: `-$20 (-20%)`
-   If only the first option is enabled, the tag will show: `-$20`
-   If only the second option is enabled, the tag will show: `-20%`
